### Notes
#### Relevant to closed-source
* Readme.md has a `<details>`-tag
** https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d
* Documentation should state which problem is being solved
* Step by step guides, especially for first-time setup
* Document early
* Doc should address the typical product adoption journey (as it applies to your project)
* Code examples must ideally compile
* Provide concise docs for all or most use cases
* Quick navigation to quickstart docs relevant to each use case
* Encourage users to participate in documentation

#### Relevant to open-source / SAAS
* Docker: Example of bad onboarding
* Kubernetes: Example of good onboarding
* User must be able to quickly and cheaply figure out if the project is a good fit
* Showcase what the product can do, provide demos
* Show / hide-buttons for the "supporting code" around example code
* Utilize community, allow them to provide examples and docs
** Slack!

### Example product adoption journey
* Exploration
** Quickly figuring out what the project does
* Getting started
** Quickly setting up the project
* Onboarding / problem solving
** Use-case examples
* Guidance and Discovery
** Traditional longer-form docs
* Reference exploration

### Questions
* How to solve the moderation challenges related to community-driven documentation (PHP.net / stackOverflow)
* Should product maintainers engage with stackoverflow users?
* Any preferred documentation tools?
* Should there be a "good docs" showcase?
