### Notes
#### Relevant to closed-source
* Readme.md supports some HTML, including the `<details>`-tag
  * Inline HTML examples (and other markdown examples) [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html)
* Documentation should state which problem is being solved
* Step by step guides, especially for first-time setup
* Document early
* Doc should address the typical product adoption journey (as it applies to your project)
* Code examples must ideally compile
* Provide concise docs for all or most use cases
* Quick navigation to quickstart docs relevant to each use case
* Encourage users to participate in documentation

#### Relevant to open-source / SAAS
* Docker: Example of bad onboarding
* Kubernetes: Example of good onboarding
* User must be able to quickly and cheaply figure out if the project is a good fit
* Showcase what the product can do, provide demos
* Show / hide-buttons for the "supporting code" around example code
* Utilize community, allow them to provide examples and docs
  * Slack!

### Example product adoption journey
* Exploration
  * Quickly figuring out what the project does
* Getting started
  * Quickly setting up the project
* Onboarding / problem solving
  * Use-case examples
* Guidance and Discovery
  * Traditional longer-form docs
* Reference exploration
