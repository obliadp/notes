### Notes
* Title is misleading, talk is more concerned with developer onboarding and education than with the processes and challenges associated with setting up dev environments.
* The talk mostly promotes minikube as the end-all solution to providing local development environments for developers.
* Briefly mentions `minikube mount` as a solution to mount host folders in containers
* Mentions [Telepresence.io](https://www.telepresence.io/) as a dev / staging tool, does not go into detail
* Mentions [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift) (local openshift env) as a PCI-compatible K8S / OpenShift dev env
