### Problems
* Getting a complete view of the state of a microservice-based app is complex
* OpenTracing is useful, but has limitations
  * Does not provide run-time debugging
  * Requires wrapping and changing the code
  * Implementation process is expensive
  * Performance overhead
  * What you don't log, you don't know

### Solution: [Squash](https://github.com/solo-io/squash)
* Features:
  * Live debugging across multiple microservices
  * Debug containers, services, etc
  * Set up breakpoints, step through code
  * View and modify variables
* Live demo in talk (see youtube-video)
  * Audience could not read screen, but video might be useful
